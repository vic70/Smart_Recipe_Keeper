## Technical Debt

1. **Testing**
   - No unit tests
   - No integration tests
   - No E2E tests

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation needs examples
   - No frontend component documentation
   - No deployment documentation

3. **Security**
   - HTTPS setup needed
   - API key rotation strategy
   - Rate limiting refinement
   - Input sanitization review

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Focus on frontend UI implementation
   - Create at least 3 core pages (login, dashboard, recipe detail)
   - Test the full flow from registration to recipe extraction

2. **Development Approach**
   - Use component-driven development
   - Implement mobile-first responsive design
   - Add proper error handling early
   - Set up basic E2E tests for critical paths

3. **API Keys**
   - Obtain Google Gemini API key (required)
   - Consider YouTube API quota limits
   - Plan for API key security in production

## Conclusion

The backend is production-ready for MVP features, but the frontend needs significant work. The modular architecture allows for easy extension of features. Priority should be given to implementing the core UI flows to make the application usable end-to-end.
